Hey, I'm Lauren & welcome to my personal website! 

I'm a student at @UofT and am currently interested in the technological acceleration of human potential. I'm also an avid public speaker 🗣️ and have spoken at numerous events about my experience as a neurodivergent tech innovator. 

My research interests lie in exploring computational 💻applications within biotech 🧬 (especially within neurobiology 🔬, medical imaging & more). I'm also super passionate about artificial intelligence🤖 in medicine (esp. in 🎗️ oncology).

In the past, I explored using brain-computer 🖥️ interface technology to create strength-based autism ♾️ diagnostics, built machine learning  🧠 tumor classification models. I consulted for companies like Walmart 🇨🇦 and the Mastercard Foundation.
